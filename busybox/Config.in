mainmenu "Configuration"

config HAVE_DOT_CONFIG
	bool
	default y

menu "Settings"

config DESKTOP
	bool "Enable compatibility for full-blown desktop systems (8kb)"
	default y
	help
	Enable applet options and features which are not essential.
	Many applet options have dedicated config options to (de)select them
	under that applet; this options enables those options which have no
	individual config item for them.

	Select this if you plan to use busybox on full-blown desktop machine
	with common Linux distro, which needs higher level of command-line
	compatibility.

	If you are preparing your build to be used on an embedded box
	where you have tighter control over the entire set of userspace
	tools, you can unselect this option for smaller code size.

config EXTRA_COMPAT
	bool "Provide compatible behavior for rare corner cases (bigger code)"
	default n
	help
	This option makes grep, sed etc handle rare corner cases
	(embedded NUL bytes and such). This makes code bigger and uses
	some GNU extensions in libc. You probably only need this option
	if you plan to run busybox on desktop.

config FEDORA_COMPAT
	bool "Building for Fedora distribution"
	default n
	help
	This option makes some tools behave like they do on Fedora.

	At the time of this writing (2017-08) this only affects uname:
	normally, uname -p (processor) and uname -i (platform)
	are shown as "unknown", but with this option uname -p
	shows the same string as uname -m (machine type),
	and so does uname -i unless machine type is i486/i586/i686 -
	then uname -i shows "i386".

config INCLUDE_SUSv2
	bool "Enable obsolete features removed before SUSv3"
	default y
	help
	This option will enable backwards compatibility with SuSv2,
	specifically, old-style numeric options ('command -1 <file>')
	will be supported in head, tail, and fold. (Note: should
	affect renice too.)

config LONG_OPTS
	bool "Support --long-options"
	default y
	help
	Enable this if you want busybox applets to use the gnu --long-option
	style, in addition to single character -a -b -c style options.

config SHOW_USAGE
	bool "Show applet usage messages"
	default y
	help
	Enabling this option, applets will show terse help messages
	when invoked with wrong arguments.
	If you do not want to show any (helpful) usage message when
	issuing wrong command syntax, you can say 'N' here,
	saving approximately 7k.

config FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
	bool "Show verbose applet usage messages"
	default y
	depends on SHOW_USAGE
	help
	All applets will show verbose help messages when invoked with --help.
	This will add a lot of text to the binary.

config FEATURE_COMPRESS_USAGE
	bool "Store applet usage messages in compressed form"
	default y
	depends on SHOW_USAGE
	help
	Store usage messages in .bz2 compressed form, uncompress them
	on-the-fly when "APPLET --help" is run.

	If you have a really tiny busybox with few applets enabled (and
	bunzip2 isn't one of them), the overhead of the decompressor might
	be noticeable. Also, if you run executables directly from ROM
	and have very little memory, this might not be a win. Otherwise,
	you probably want this.

config LFS
	bool "Support files > 2 GB"
	default y
	help
	If you need to work with large files, enable this option.
	This will have no effect if your kernel or your C
	library lacks large file support for large files. Some of the
	programs that can benefit from large file support include dd, gzip,
	cp, mount, tar.

config TIME64
	bool "Support 64bit wide time types"
	default y
	depends on LFS
	help
	Make times later than 2038 representable for several libc syscalls
	(stat, clk_gettime etc.). Note this switch is specific to glibc
	and has no effect on platforms that already use 64bit wide time types
	(i.e. all 64bit archs and some selected 32bit archs (currently riscv
	and x32)).

config PAM
	bool "Support PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)"
	default n
	help
	Use PAM in some applets (currently login and httpd) instead
	of direct access to password database.

config FEATURE_DEVPTS
	bool "Use the devpts filesystem for Unix98 PTYs"
	default y
	help
	Enable if you want to use Unix98 PTY support. If enabled,
	busybox will use /dev/ptmx for the master side of the pseudoterminal
	and /dev/pts/<number> for the slave side. Otherwise, BSD style
	/dev/ttyp<number> will be used. To use this option, you should have
	devpts mounted.

config FEATURE_UTMP
	bool "Support utmp file"
	default y
	help
	The file /var/run/utmp is used to track who is currently logged in.
	With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	will create and delete entries there.
	"who" applet requires this option.

config FEATURE_WTMP
	bool "Support wtmp file"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_UTMP
	help
	The file /var/run/wtmp is used to track when users have logged into
	and logged out of the system.
	With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	will append new entri
